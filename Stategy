🎯 Step-by-Step Strategy for Most Effective DSA Preparation
🔥 Goal: Crack OA + Interviews with Confidence
Timeframe: 1.5 months
Target: Quality > Quantity
Focus: Pattern recognition + real interview-level readiness

📍 Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Foundation & Weak Area Fixing
✅ Step 1: Revisit your 80 LeetCode problems
Go back to unsolved or partially solved problems

For each, ask:

Did I understand the logic?

Can I write it from scratch now?

What pattern was used (sliding window, prefix sum, etc.)?

Re-solve 20–30 of them from scratch without peeking.

✅ Step 2: Focused Topic-Wise Practice
Start Striver’s SDE Sheet or NeetCode 150 and go topic-by-topic:

Week	Topic	# Problems	Key Patterns
1	Arrays + Prefix + Sliding Window	15–20	Two pointer, hash, prefix sum
2	HashMaps + Strings + Stack/Queue	20	Hashing, monotonic stack, queue

👉 After every problem: write a note in your tracker:

Time + Space complexity

Core idea/pattern

If stuck → solve similar 2 problems to reinforce

📍 Phase 2 (Week 3-5): Build Pattern Recognition & Speed
✅ Step 3: Shift from topic to mixed practice
Start solving LeetCode Daily + 2 mixed random problems

Use Blind 75 or Top Interview 150 as base

Solve under time pressure → simulate OAs

🧠 Focus now:

Can I map the problem to a known pattern in <3 mins?

📌 Use this pattern-to-problem map:

Pattern	Example Problems
Sliding window	LC 3, 76
Two pointers	LC 11, 15
Binary search	LC 33, 34
Greedy	LC 55, 45
Recursion/backtracking	LC 39, 46
DP	LC 70, 322, 198
Graph	LC 200, 133, 207

📍 Phase 3 (Final Week): Mock + Revision + Debugging Mindset
✅ Step 4: Simulate real OAs
Use LeetCode Weekly/Contest archives

Set a timer: 90 mins / 3 problems

Analyze after every test: Why did I fail this one?

📘 Keep a “mistake diary” with:

Problem link

What went wrong (logic, edge case, syntax)

Fix/lesson

✅ Step 5: Revise Patterns & Edge Cases
Revisit your notes

Redo 20–30 key problems fast (without editor)

Practice dry running / debugging on paper
